This is a practice assignment from TheOdinProject to learn html

I will be building a basic recipe website that will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes. Since I havven't learned css yet the website won't look very pretty yet but in the future once I have learned css I will revisit this project to style it up with css.
